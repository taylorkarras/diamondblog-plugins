# diamondblog-plugins
These are plugins that I've made for DiamondBlog as a way to extend my own functionality. The following plugins are included.

1. SocialPost (post to social media)
2. Push Notifications (push notifications to web browsers)
3. Google News (xml map for Google News service)
4. GAnalytics (to insert Google Analytics code)
5. AddThis (to add AddThis code)
6. AdSense (to add AdSense code)
7. ReCaptcha (to add ReCaptcha code)

To install, simply drag them to the plugins folder of your diamondblog installation.

Thank you for using DiamondBlog.
